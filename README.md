# Vehicle Sound Classification 🚗🔊  


**Welcome to this Applied Machine Learning project.**  
This repository contains the implementation of a vehicle sound classification system that predicts the vehicle type among **8 classes** based on a `.wav` audio file.

**📎 Paper:** [Vehicle Engine Sound Classification](paper/VehicleNET-paper.pdf)

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software and tools installed:

- **PyCharm**: We recommend using VsCOde as your IDE, since it offers a highly tailored experience for Python development. 

## Getting Started
### Setting up your own repository
1. Clone this repostiry by running in your terminal :
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alex86590212/Applied-ML-Group-7.git
   ```
2. Install the requirements :
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. After cloning the reposity run this command to make sure you are in the right directory :
   ```bash
   cd Applied-ML-Group-7
   ```
4. After this run this command to acceess the API :
    ```bash
    uvicorn main_api:app --reload
    ```
5. Click the API that opened on a local port in the terminal
6. Go to the directory on the opened google tab and add "/docs":
   example : http://000.0.0.0:8000 and add /docs so the final result is : http://000.0.0.0:8000/docs
7. Press the try it out button
8. Where you see the string text enter one of the following to choose which model you want to use to predict : 'CNN', 'RNN', 'Combined'
   make sure you write them exactly as stated here otherwise it will return an error
9. Submit a .wav file and see the result ! Mind the fact that we only accept .wav files at the moment and if you sumbit any other file type it will return an error.

# Training Models Locally

After you’ve processed your data, follow these steps to train any of the three models on your machine:

1. **Configure `main.py`**

   Open `main.py` and set the following variables:

   ```python
   TRAIN_FROM_SCRATCH = False # only skip preprocessing if already done
   NUMBER = <model_number>    # 1: RNN, 2: CNN, 3: Combined Model
   MODE = "train"           # switch to training mode
   ```

2. **(Optional) Preprocess from Scratch**

   If you haven’t generated spectrograms and manual features yet, set:

   ```python
   TRAIN_FROM_SCRATCH = True
   ```

   Then run the script once to split data, resample audio, reduce noise, extract spectrograms (128×128), and compute manual features.

3. **Run Training**

   Execute:

   ```bash
   python -m project.models.main
   ```

4. **Model-Specific Details**

   * **RNN**: Trains `RnnClassifier` on PCA-reduced sequential features.
   * **CNN**: Trains `CNN` using 128×128 spectrogram inputs.
   * **Combined Model**: Trains `CombinedClassifier`, merging spectrogram and manual feature streams.

5. **Checkpoints & Outputs**

   Trained weights are saved automatically to the paths defined in `config.py`:

   ```python
   config.RNN_best_model_weights      # e.g., models/rnn_best.pth
   config.CNN_best_model_weights      # e.g., models/cnn_best.pth
   config.Combined_best_model_weights # e.g., models/combined_best.pth
   ```

Adjust any paths in `config.py` before retraining as needed.
